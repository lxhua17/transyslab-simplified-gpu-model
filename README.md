# transyslab-simplified-gpu-model
A simplified traffic model for gpu

The simplified Lane level mesoscopic traffic simulation model
It is equivalent to vehicle driving process with macro traffic flow model and vehicle queuing process with point queuing model. 

The model includes a simple version without stretching-segment design, and a version considering the stretching-segment design of the urban intersection.
